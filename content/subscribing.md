How to subscribe on blog feed?

I have multiple options for you

## RSS feeds for categories
I have R specific posts that you can follow in this rss feed:

<https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/categories/r/index.xml>

if I create new blog posts about other categories you can find them under the 
[https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/categories/]categoryname[/index.xml] format.

for instance if I created one called thedarkteatimeofthesoal you could find all posts
of that category in 
<https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/categories/r/index.xml> *"obviously that does not exist yet"*

the general feed can be found in <https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/index.xml>

## Specific tags to follow 
Are you interested in only certain kind of blogs you can also follow a tag only
<https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/tags/tutorial/index.xml> 


## Other ways
I'll try to tweet everything as well (see tweet button below).

I also aggregate some of my posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to/rmhogervorst "a great platform for developers") <a href="https://dev.to/rmhogervorst">
