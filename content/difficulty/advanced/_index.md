title: "Advanced level posts"

These levels have been defined by the software carpentry people, and I have modified them to this:
* [beginner](/difficulty/beginner/): _You have just started out in this topic. You do not yet know how things are supposed to work. You do not have a mental model of this thing_
* [intermediate](/difficulty/intermediate/): _You are a regular user of this software/tool/concept, you have a mental model, but it is not very sophisticated_
* [advanced](/difficulty/advanced/): _You have a sophisticated mental model how things work, and you even know when the model breaks, when it does not match reality._
