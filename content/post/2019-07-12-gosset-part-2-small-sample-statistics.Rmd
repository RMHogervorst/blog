Good tutorials are: 
- quick. tell what you want to do, how to do it
- easy: success is important. playtest the tutorial under different circumstances
- not to easy: Don't get htem throug ht toturoial onluy to runinto a wall later on. 


FOCUS WAS ON HOPS, 

FROM ZILIAK: So the crucial question facing scientific brewers
was: how can experimental science advance economies of scale in brewing? And
how can inferential statistics help to control and improve product, while at the
same time, help to reduce average total costs for the firm?
Take the choice of hops, for example. In 1898, Guinness used 4.72 million
imperial pounds of the fruitful yellow cone. The traditional method of choosing
hops based on looks or fragrance wasn’t efficient or reliable on this large scale. But
was it any more reliable to take small samples out of a larger quantity of hops, test
them for certain key characteristics, and then draw an inference about the general
quality of the whole lot?


In 1898, Thomas B. Case, Guinness’s first scientific brewer, led a team to
address this question. Case and his team felt that the key characteristic was the
degree of soft resins in the hops. Thus, Case analyzed the average percentage of soft
and hard resins found in samples of 50 grams taken from several seasons of
American and Kent hops (Case, 1898, p. 47). He compared his samples with those
of a cooperating scientist named Briant. For example, Case examined 11 samples
of hops (n ⫽ 11) from Kent in 1897, finding on average 8.1 percent soft resins
content. Briant examined 14 samples drawn from the same lot, finding 8.4 percent
soft resins—a difference of 0.3 percentage points. The mean difference between
their two samples of “American, 1895” was even higher, at 0.7 percent (soft resins)
and 1.0 percent (hard).


Gosset underscored a positive correlation in the normal distribution curve between
“the square root of the number of observations” and the level of statistical signifi-
cance. Other things equal, he wrote, “the greater the number of observations of
which means are taken [the larger the sample size], the smaller the [probable or
standard] error” (p. 5). “And the curve which represents their frequency of error,”
he illustrated, “becomes taller and narrower” (p. 7).
Since its discovery in the early nineteenth century, tables of the normal
probability curve had been created for large samples; Stigler (1986, 1999) offers a
useful early history of the normal distribution. The relation between sample size
and “significance” was rarely explored.

Gosset’s analysis focused on malt extract, which was measured in “degrees
saccharine” per barrel of 168 lbs. malt. 13 At the time, an extract in the neighbor-
hood of 133° gave the targeted level of alcohol content for Guinness’s beer. A
higher extract affected the life of the beer, and also the alcohol content—which in
turn affected the excise tax paid on alcoholic beverages. In Gosset’s view, ⫾.5 was
a difference or error in malt extract level which Guinness and its customers could
swallow. “It might be maintained,” he said, that malt extract “should be [estimated]
within .5 of the true result with a probability of 10 to 1” (p. 7). Using mean
differences of extract values with samples drawn from the Main and Experimental
breweries, he then calculated the odds of observing the stipulated accuracy for
small and large numbers of observations (p. 7). He found:

QUESTION IS THIS: 
YOU CANNOT TEST EVERYTHING IN THE BAG, BUT THERE ARE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SAMPLES
HOW  MANY SAMPLES MUST YOU TAKE TO COME CLOSE TO THE 'TRUE' AVERAGE AMOUNT OF
THAT ENTIRE BATCH. 

IT WAS KNOWN THAT A LARGE SAMPLE WOULD FIND THE TRUE MEAN. BUT THAT IS NOT 
PRACTICAL, WE CAN ONLY TEST SO MANY OF THE BAG, EVERY HOP YOU TEST CAN NO LONGER
BE USED FOR THE PROCESS. IT IS ALSO RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE TO TEST THE SAMPLE
SO THE COSTS ARE INCREASING. 

SO HOW MANY SAMPLES MUST YOU TAKE TO BE CERTAIN ENOUGHT THAT THE BAG WAS GOOD?

THE GENIOUS OF THIS GOSSET WAS THAT HE SIMULATED SAMPLING PROCESS BY
- TAKING A BAG OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN MANY MANY SAMPLES SO THEY ACTUALLY KNEW
WHAT THE AVERAGE OF THE BAG WAS. 
- HE DETERMINED THAT THE IDEAL WAS 133 DEGREES OF SUCROSE OR SOMETHING
- HE DETERMINED THAT .5 FROM THAT POINT WAS NOT NOTICIBLE BY DRINKERS
- HE SET A THRESHOLD OF HOW MANY TIMES HE AT LEAST WOULD WANT TO BE RIGHT
- HE THAN SIMULATED TAKING SAMPLES OUT OF THAT BIG BAG OF NUMBERS
- AND COUNTING IF THE SAMPLE AVERAGE WAS IN THAT INTERVAL
[KOPF FINALLY MADE THIS CLEAR TO ME, HE SIMULATED]

Odds in favour of smaller error than .5 [are:]
2
3
4
5
82
observations
⬙
⬙
⬙
⬙
4:1
7:1
12:1
19:1
practically infinite
Thus, Gosset (p. 8) concluded, “In order to get the accuracy we require [that
is, 10 to 1 odds with .5 accuracy], we must, therefore, take the mean of [at least]
four determinations.”


 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED, AND SPEND A YEAR TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WORKING
 IN LAB OF KARL PEARSON TO LEARN MORE.
 HIS FINAL OUTPUT WAS A TABLE OF / DISTRIBUTION. 


Notice that in Gosset’s view, setting the “degree of probability” to be “treated
as sufficient” is not to be made “conventionally” or by “some outside authority in
mathematics.” Instead, the “degree of certainty to be aimed at,” Gosset wrote,
depends on the opportunity cost of following a result as if true, added to the
opportunity cost of conducting the experiment itself. Gosset never deviated from
this central position
