I went to UseR-2017 in Brussels. It was my first time at an UseR (I have been to the first satRday), AND I LOVED IT!
There were many interesting talks, I am so going to use Fast Frugal Trees in the future for instance 
and I saw a lot of shiny applications and R professional.

But best of all. I talked to a lot of people, people I only spoke to online. 
Thanked some people for their help in my packages and generally had a lot of fun!

One of the fun things I did was asking people about packages that should be created but 
are not yet there, I put them here:  <https://github.com/RMHogervorst/shouldbeapackage> Contribute if you want. 

One of the packages that should exist is one that gives you suggestions for Kareoke, preferably powerballads, 
of course I used one of the breaks to create a github page and a package. However a suggestion app needs songs, so 
me and [Kevin O'Brian](https://twitter.com/kobriendublin) tricked people into adding to the list of powerballads. 

**What we still need though, is a shiny app that you can access from your phone when you are IN the kareoke bar.** 

We put the package under a new github group: [R-eoke ](https://github.com/Reoke/powrballad) 
And yes, submit your songs! 

See you around.
