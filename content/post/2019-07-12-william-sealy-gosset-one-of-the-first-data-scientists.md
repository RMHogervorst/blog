I wanted to write a series of posts about William Sealy Gosset, the t-distribution
and his contribution to the world of statistics.
-->

In my mind William Sealy Gosset, better known as 'Student' is the first data 
scientist. He used math to solve real world business problems, he worked on
experimental design, small sample statistics, quality control and beer. In fact, 
I think we should start a fanclub! W. S. Gosset had qualities that we should
emulate. He was smart, resourceful, relatively self-taught, humble^[1] and like so
many of us data scientists unfortunately constrained by an NDA from his 
employer^[2] ...


> The Guinness future was in “scientific brewing”—large-scale, industrially con-
trolled brewing—wherein all factors of production, from barley breeding to taste
testing, are controlled, improved, and confirmed by experimental science. A de-
gree from either Oxford or Cambridge in a natural science was a minimum
requirement for a Guinness brewer in the new era  -- Guinnessometrics - Stephen T. Ziliak

This does sounds a lot like applied statistics, or operational statistics, or... 
data science!

In his 37 year career William S. Gosset worked on improving the beer consistency
and making the brewery more efficient. He picked up made impressive improvements
in A/B testing and small sample statistics. Mostly because he just wanted to 
improve the work.


In the next post I will go into his work on small sample statistics, the work
that defined what we NOW call the t-distribution.

gathered business insight by focussing on the cost and gain from experiment. 

and like many of us, hampered by a NDA that prevented him from publishing under his own name, mentioning beer or the guiness brewery by name.

Upon completing his work on the t-distribution, Gosset was eager to make his work public. It was an important finding, and one he wanted to share with the wider world. The managers of Guinness were not so keen on this. They realized they had an advantage over the competition by using this method, and were not excited about relinquishing that leg up. If Gosset were to publish the paper, other breweries would be on to them.

So they came to a compromise. Guinness agreed to allow Gosset to publish the finding, as long as he used a pseudonym. This way, competitors would not be able to realize that someone on Guinness’s payroll was doing such research, and figure out that the company’s scientifically enlightened approach was key to their success.

He was simply interested in solving the problems that would make sure each beer was as good as the last one.

Edward Deming, Udny Yule, and Florence Nightingale David, respectively called him a “very humble and pleasing personality,” “very pleasant chap” and “A nice man […] without a jealous bone in his body.” Both Karl Pearson and R.A. Fisher, the two most famous statistical thinkers of the early 20th Century, who were known to hate each other, found common ground in their fondness for Gosset.[The Guinness Brewer who revolutionaized Statistics - Dan Kopf]
[2]: The Guinness brewery realized they had a competitive advantage with their small sample tests over other breweries and thus they prevented all scientists in the company from publishing under their own name, mentioning the name Guinness or the word beer.
