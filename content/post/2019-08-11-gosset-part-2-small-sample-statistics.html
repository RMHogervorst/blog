FOCUS WAS ON HOPS, 

FROM ZILIAK: So the crucial question facing scientific brewers
was: how can experimental science advance economies of scale in brewing? And
how can inferential statistics help to control and improve product, while at the
same time, help to reduce average total costs for the firm?
Take the choice of hops, for example. In 1898, Guinness used 4.72 million
imperial pounds of the fruitful yellow cone. The traditional method of choosing
hops based on looks or fragrance wasn’t efficient or reliable on this large scale. But
was it any more reliable to take small samples out of a larger quantity of hops, test
them for certain key characteristics, and then draw an inference about the general
quality of the whole lot?


In 1898, Thomas B. Case, Guinness’s first scientific brewer, led a team to
address this question. Case and his team felt that the key characteristic was the
degree of soft resins in the hops. Thus, Case analyzed the average percentage of soft
and hard resins found in samples of 50 grams taken from several seasons of
American and Kent hops (Case, 1898, p. 47). He compared his samples with those
of a cooperating scientist named Briant. For example, Case examined 11 samples
of hops (n ⫽ 11) from Kent in 1897, finding on average 8.1 percent soft resins
content. Briant examined 14 samples drawn from the same lot, finding 8.4 percent
soft resins—a difference of 0.3 percentage points. The mean difference between
their two samples of “American, 1895” was even higher, at 0.7 percent (soft resins)
and 1.0 percent (hard).


Gosset underscored a positive correlation in the normal distribution curve between
“the square root of the number of observations” and the level of statistical signifi-
cance. Other things equal, he wrote, “the greater the number of observations of
which means are taken [the larger the sample size], the smaller the [probable or
standard] error” (p. 5). “And the curve which represents their frequency of error,”
he illustrated, “becomes taller and narrower” (p. 7).
Since its discovery in the early nineteenth century, tables of the normal
probability curve had been created for large samples; Stigler (1986, 1999) offers a
useful early history of the normal distribution. The relation between sample size
and “significance” was rarely explored.

Gosset’s analysis focused on malt extract, which was measured in “degrees
saccharine” per barrel of 168 lbs. malt. 13 At the time, an extract in the neighbor-
hood of 133° gave the targeted level of alcohol content for Guinness’s beer. A
higher extract affected the life of the beer, and also the alcohol content—which in
turn affected the excise tax paid on alcoholic beverages. In Gosset’s view, ⫾.5 was
a difference or error in malt extract level which Guinness and its customers could
swallow. “It might be maintained,” he said, that malt extract “should be [estimated]
within .5 of the true result with a probability of 10 to 1” (p. 7). Using mean
differences of extract values with samples drawn from the Main and Experimental
breweries, he then calculated the odds of observing the stipulated accuracy for
small and large numbers of observations (p. 7). He found:

QUESTION IS THIS: 
YOU CANNOT TEST EVERYTHING IN THE BAG, BUT THERE ARE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SAMPLES
HOW  MANY SAMPLES MUST YOU TAKE TO COME CLOSE TO THE 'TRUE' AVERAGE AMOUNT OF
THAT ENTIRE BATCH. 

IT WAS KNOWN THAT A LARGE SAMPLE WOULD FIND THE TRUE MEAN. BUT THAT IS NOT 
PRACTICAL, WE CAN ONLY TEST SO MANY OF THE BAG, EVERY HOP YOU TEST CAN NO LONGER
BE USED FOR THE PROCESS. IT IS ALSO RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE TO TEST THE SAMPLE
SO THE COSTS ARE INCREASING. 

SO HOW MANY SAMPLES MUST YOU TAKE TO BE CERTAIN ENOUGHT THAT THE BAG WAS GOOD?

THE GENIOUS OF THIS GOSSET WAS THAT HE SIMULATED SAMPLING PROCESS BY
- TAKING A BAG OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN MANY MANY SAMPLES SO THEY ACTUALLY KNEW
WHAT THE AVERAGE OF THE BAG WAS. 
- HE DETERMINED THAT THE IDEAL WAS 133 DEGREES OF SUCROSE OR SOMETHING
- HE DETERMINED THAT .5 FROM THAT POINT WAS NOT NOTICIBLE BY DRINKERS
- HE SET A THRESHOLD OF HOW MANY TIMES HE AT LEAST WOULD WANT TO BE RIGHT
- HE THAN SIMULATED TAKING SAMPLES OUT OF THAT BIG BAG OF NUMBERS
- AND COUNTING IF THE SAMPLE AVERAGE WAS IN THAT INTERVAL
[KOPF FINALLY MADE THIS CLEAR TO ME, HE SIMULATED]

Odds in favour of smaller error than .5 [are:]
2
3
4
5
82
observations
⬙
⬙
⬙
⬙
4:1
7:1
12:1
19:1
practically infinite
Thus, Gosset (p. 8) concluded, “In order to get the accuracy we require [that
is, 10 to 1 odds with .5 accuracy], we must, therefore, take the mean of [at least]
four determinations.”


 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED, AND SPEND A YEAR TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND WORKING
 IN LAB OF KARL PEARSON TO LEARN MORE.
 HIS FINAL OUTPUT WAS A TABLE OF / DISTRIBUTION. 


Notice that in Gosset’s view, setting the “degree of probability” to be “treated
as sufficient” is not to be made “conventionally” or by “some outside authority in
mathematics.” Instead, the “degree of certainty to be aimed at,” Gosset wrote,
depends on the opportunity cost of following a result as if true, added to the
opportunity cost of conducting the experiment itself. Gosset never deviated from
this central position

<p>A NICE ONELINER HERE?</p>
<p>This post is an explainer about the small sample experiment and determining
the ideal sample size for inference.</p>
<p>Economic perspectives and business logic</p>
<div id="brewing-beer-at-scale" class="section level1">
<h1>Brewing beer at scale</h1>
<p>One of the problems William S. Gosset worked on was determining the quality
of Malt. To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing">brew beer</a> you need 3
ingredients, yeast, hops and a cereal grain. You start with extracting the starch
from the grain into water. You then flavoring the resulting sweet liquid with
hops and fermenting that mixture with yeast.</p>
<p>Gosset worked on all three ingredients, but in this post I will look into
the cereal grain.</p>
<div id="beer-malts-and-beer-technique" class="section level2">
<h2>Beer, malts and beer technique</h2>
<p>Now, beer brewing has been done since the 6th century BCE, and all the steps
have their own specialised names<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> , which are different in all languages. So I will
be talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt">malt</a>, but remember that it is just a source of starch, a
source of sugars <em>(I’m sorry chemists/ biologist, I have to simplify this a bit)</em>.</p>
<p>Grain, Barley, transforming into malt, as seen here. <img src="/post/2019-07-12-gosset-part-2-small-sample-statistics_files/Malt_en_grain.JPG" alt="Malt and grain, detail of individual sprouted malt" /></p>
<p>The source of starch in beer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley">barley</a>,
this grain is first dried, cleaned and then wetted. This starts the biological
process of germination in the grain (it gets ready to start a new barley plant).
In that process some enzymes are made that will break down starch to smaller
sugars. Now the grains are ready to start a new plant and, now we sort of kill
it by forced drying. The end result of half germinated barley is called malt or
malted barley.</p>
<p>The amount of sugar in the mixture determines the maximum ammount of alcohol the
yeast can create in next steps. Higher alcohol content keeps the beer for longer
periods, but makes the taste different.</p>
</div>
<div id="malt-and-sugars" class="section level2">
<h2>Malt and sugars</h2>
<p>Guiness Malt in Gosset’s time, came from Irish and English Barley stock.
Since the sugar content in malt can vary from batch to batch, brewers need to
check the sugar content. However there are only so many brewers and there is
checking every batch is not scalable. The Guinness brewery was one of the
largest in the world and this would not do.</p>
<p>The sugar content of malt extract was measured by degrees saccharine per barrel
of 168 poinds malt weight. In earlier experiments the brewers determined that
an extract around 133 degrees saccharine gave the desired alcohol level.</p>
<p>Way more saccharine would affect the stability and life of the beer and increase
the alcohol content of the beer, however that would also increase the tax,
Guinness had to pay to British goverment. A lower level of alcohol would make
the beer go bad earlier and crucially, costumers would go to a competiter.</p>
<p>So you better make sure the malt extract is close to 133 degrees saccharine.
In Gosset’s view, 0.5 degrees was a difference or error in malt extract level
which Guinness and its customers could accept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It might be maintained,” he said, that malt extract “should be [estimated]
within .5 of the true result with a probability of 10 to 1”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However how can we be certain that a barrel has a sugar content of 133 degrees?</p>
<p>They could take samples, and average those, but how many samples would give us
enough certainty (that is with odds of 10 to 1 that the sample average is
within 0.5 degree of the real value)?</p>
</div>
<div id="simulation" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Malt, green, a handful of green malt</p>
</div>
<p>Gosset and his co workers went over to simulation. THIS IS WEIRDLY WRITTEN
They had a lot of samples for one barrel, and Gosset simulated what would
happen if they drew and averaged multiple samples. And generalized this to
what would happen if they sampled from the all of the barrels.</p>
<p>And that is what I will show in R code.</p>
<p>So we are talking about sampling <img src="/post/2019-08-11-gosset-part-2-small-sample-statistics_files/randy_sampling.gif" alt="Randy Marshal sampling beer and wine (South Park)" /></p>
<p>GIVEN A NORMAL BAG OF BARLEY/MALT EXTRACT WE WANT TO BE WITHIN .5 OF REAL VALUE
10 TO 1.</p>
<p>A/(A + B ) 10/(10+1) = 10/11 0.9090909</p>
<div id="simulating-drawing-from-a-barrel" class="section level3">
<h3>Simulating drawing from a barrel</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>First the goal in clearer language.
We want to know how many samples you have to draw to know what the real degree
saccharine level of the barrel is. With a 10 to 1 odds of being within 0.5 degree.</p>
<p>Let’s first transform that odds to probabilities, because I don’t know what
those mean. A 10 to 1 odds means ten successes and 1 failure, so it is really
10 out of 11, 10/11=0.909.</p>
<p>First we create a dataset.<br />
Say we have a large amount of MALT extract
We took many many many many samples from one barrel, and so we know
what the saccharine level of the barrel is.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(7334)
degrees_sacharine = rnorm(3000,mean = 133, sd = 0.6) # this is really just a guess</code></pre>
<p>Then I create some functions to take a sample, a function to determine if that
value is within the range, and finally I combine them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>take_sample_average &lt;- function(bag= degrees_sacharine, sample_size){
  mean(sample(bag, sample_size, replace= TRUE))
}
within_range &lt;- function(value){
  ifelse(value &gt; 132.5 &amp; value &lt; 133.5, TRUE, FALSE)
}
is_sample_within_range &lt;- function(sample_size){
  take_sample_average(bag = degrees_sacharine, sample_size = sample_size) %&gt;% 
    within_range()
}
# for example what if we take 3 samples?
take_sample_average(bag = degrees_sacharine, 3)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 132.8</code></pre>
<p>For example:
So now we take 2 samples out of the bag, and get (142.2745, 119.4484)/2 = 142.2745.
Is this within the range of 132.5 and 133.5? no.</p>
<p>But how often, on average am I within the real value of the bag?
We simulate taking 2 to 15 samples from the barrel and averaging per sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sampling_experiments &lt;-  
  tibble(
  N = seq_len(2500)
) %&gt;% 
  mutate( # there is probably a more concise way to do this
    sample_02 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 2)),
    sample_03 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 3)),
    sample_04 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 4)),
    sample_05 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 5)),
    sample_06 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 6)),
    sample_07 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 7)),
    sample_08 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 8)),
    sample_09 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 9)),
    sample_10 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 10)),
    sample_15 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 15)),
    sample_20 = purrr::map_lgl(N, ~is_sample_within_range(sample_size = 20)),
    )</code></pre>
<p>So how many times are the samples within the range?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sampling_experiments %&gt;% 
  summarize_all(.funs = ~sum(.)/n()) %&gt;% # this doesn&#39;t read that well
  # So I reshape the data, remove the N column and remove the sample_ part
  gather(key = &quot;sample_size&quot;, value = &quot;prob_in_range&quot;, sample_02:sample_20) %&gt;% 
  select(-N) %&gt;% 
  mutate(sample_size = str_remove(sample_size,pattern =  &quot;sample_&quot;)) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 11 x 2
##    sample_size prob_in_range
##    &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 02                  0.755
##  2 03                  0.854
##  3 04                  0.901
##  4 05                  0.932

##  9 10                  0.991
## 10 15                  0.999
## 11 20                  0.999</code></pre>
<p>Gosset found in his experiments that he needed at least 4 samples for a
estimation with an odds of at least 10 to 1, which is a probability of
approximately 0.909.</p>
<p>In our case for our bag of estimations we would say at least 5 samples to
get these odds or better.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge the Guinness brewery knew it could test the malt extract
by taking 4 samples out of every batch to get an approximation of the true sugar
content of a batch that would be correct in 10 out of 11 times.</p>
<p>That meant that the brewery could use this technique to check the bags of malt
extract, in stead of a master brewer sampling, and feeling the bags.
You can scale the number of tests, but not the amount of brewers/ checkers.</p>
<p>The brewers were happy, Gosset was too. But he realized there must be a system
there, a way to determine</p>
