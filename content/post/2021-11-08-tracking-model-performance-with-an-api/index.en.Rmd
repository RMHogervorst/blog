I'm a maker, and so as my role becomes more and more engineer I want to engineer things. In the last few weeks I've been building a modeltracking API. While I was building it, I found out it is very much like MLflow, a python project with R binding (but needs reticulate).

So I made a [modelserver](https://github.com/RMHogervorst/modelserver)

Here is the high level design

```
[API in plumber] - database (sqlite by default)

[haven't build a postgres part yet.]
```

I create several tables to track stuff and used one id to match it all. 

For every run we need a token, that token can be used to glue together everything. 


### Reproducibility
