This blog is mostly focused on R (find all those post  [here](/categories/r)), 
but there are other categories, [Find the complete list here](/categories).

Every post on this blog has multiple [tags](/tags/#), I tag every post at least according to
 packages used, dataset used and 
a difficulty ( [beginner](/difficulty/beginner/), [intermediate](/difficulty/intermediate/), 
and [advanced](/difficulty/advanced/)). 


Find all the [tags here](/tags/). 

I also write down half formed ideas and notes to myself on a secondary (or is it
third already?) blog: [notes.rmhogervorst.nl](https://notes.rmhogervorst.nl/)
