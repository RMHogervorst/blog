Can we detect the essence of a set of books with automated tools? In this case I want to extract the most important words and the emotions in books. But mostly I just wanted to play around with tidytext tools on one of my favorite book series: the Hitch hikers guide to the galaxy!

<!-- why this problem -->
Imagin  you have a set of books but you want to know what they are about? One thing we can do is sentiment analysis <https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html "an amazing book with great examples that I learned a lot from">.  

<!--approach -->

I load in the dataset (a set of epub files from my computer), transform them into a tidy format. Do a tf-idf per book and return the words that are more typical for a specific book than for the entire series. I create several plots of sentiment and tf-idf with ggplot2 and the tidytext package. 

I love the tidytext package by David Robinson and Julia Silge @R-tidytext !

<!--packages used and data used -->

```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(pubcrawl)
```

The books are of course copyrighted so I cannot share the files with you, that would be piracy. 
I organize my projects per folder
